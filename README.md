## Resume Generation

The Python script in this repository (`Res_2.py`) generates the resume content dynamically based on the information provided in `Resume.py`. It uses the `reportlab` library to create a PDF version of the resume and provides an interactive menu to view, email, or save the resume in different formats.

Feel free to explore the source code in this repository to see how the resume generation works.

## Usage

1. Clone the Repository

    - Clone the repository to your local machine:

        ```git clone https://github.com/kcarden/PythonResume.git```

3. Create Your Resume

    - Navigate to the project directory:

        ```cd PythonResume```

    - Use the provided resume.py as a template and fill in your own resume details, such as your name, contact information, objective, work experience, skills, education, certificates/training, and additional skills.

4. Configure Email Credentials

    - Open the env.py file and replace the placeholder values with your actual email credentials.

    ```
    # env.py

    # Replace these placeholders with your actual email credentials
    SMTP_SERVER = "your_smtp_server"
    SMTP_PORT = 587
    SMTP_USERNAME = "your_email@example.com"
    SMTP_PASSWORD = "your_email_password"

    ```

    - Configuring email credentials is required if you want to use the resume generator to send your resume via email. If not, you can skip this step and still generate your resume locally without email functionality.

5. Generate Your Resume

    -Run the Python script Res_2.py to generate your resume in various formats (PDF, DOCX, and TXT) and view it interactively in the terminal.

    ```python Res_2.py```

Customize the resume template in resume.py to add more sections or change the formatting to suit your preferences and requirements.
Enhance the Res_2.py script to include new features or improvements.
That's it! You now have a Python-based resume generator to create and distribute your resume in various formats easily. Good luck with your job search!
